# IBM Business Automation Insights - Technical Workshop
**IBM Business Automation Insights (BAI)** have been created to provide unified **Operational Intelligence** across all the components of **IBM Digital Business Automation** – Workflow, Robotic Process Automation, Business Decisions, Content and Data Capture.

The operational intelligence allows to see in real time what is going on in the whole processing chain and to take immediate action. It allows to analyze historical data and optimize the processing based on a consistent end-to-end view. It also provides operational data to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The data can feed continuously trained AI services allowing to move the intelligence of business operations to the next level with AI-based prediction and classification.

This technical workshop is focused on BAI specifically in context of **IBM Business Automation Workflow**. You will discover how BAI can collect, process, store and visualize events generated by running processes and cases in real time. BAI leverages popular technologies like Elasticsearch, Kibana and Hadoop HDFS. It runs on containers with cloud-native architecture.

You will also learn how BAI can provide data for continuous training of Machine Learning model which provides guidance during process execution making it more efficient. The provided guidance is based on previous experience when AI is looking over the shoulders of people who are processing the tasks and learning from human actions.

Agenda:
- Introduction to IBM Digital Business Automation
- Technical overview of IBM Business Automation Insights specifically with Business Automation Workflow
- Live demonstrations
- Selective hands-on labs for different topics based on your preference
- Summary with Q&A session

BAI is replacing Performance Data Warehouse in Business Automation Workflow. Every current Workflow customer is now entitled to use BAI. BAI is also available as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Automation.

The environments for the labs will remain available for couple of days after the workshop so you will be able to discover all the available labs on your own.

Before attending the virtual workshop, we recommend watching this brief [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLPi281Z8NQ).

# Presentations

# Environments
Two kinds of environment will be used during the hands-on labs. One is ocntainer-based with OpenShift. Second one is on-prem with BAI installed on plain Docker with no Kubernetes cluster.

1. Kubernetes-based environment with BAI on OpenShift<br>
<http://bluedemos.com/show/3630>
2. On-prem environment with BAI4Sever on plain Docker<br>
<http://bluedemos.com/show/3917>

# Labs
## Lab 1 - Setup BAI events for BPMN, Case and ODM with Kibana dashboards
This lab shows how to select business data propagated as payload of BAI events from BPMN processes, Cases and ODM Decision Services to the BAI. After that you can learn how to leverage these data and build Kibana Dashboards for operational management.

[Lab instructions](labs/swat-containers-baw-odm)

Duration approx. 4 hours.

## Lab 2 - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with BAI
Set of labs showing how to use data collected by BAI to train ML models which can be used to make processes and decision logic smarter.

[Lab instructions](labs/ai/README.md)

Duration approx. 1 hour.

## Lab 3 - Performance Center

TODO

Duration approx. 1 hour.

## Lab 4 - OpenDistro Alerts

TODO

Duration approx. 30 minutes.
