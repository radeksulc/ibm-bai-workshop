    "# Using Spark ML and IBM Business Automation Insights to estimate process duration\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence can be combined with business process management in more than one way. For example, Artificial intellignece can help transforming unstructured data into data that a process can work with, through techniques such as visual or text recognition. Assistants and bots can help providing a better user experience. Several IBM Watson services serve this purpose but a business process also captures a lot of business data.\n",
    "This notebook shows how to take better benefit of this data and inject Machine Learning techniques to predict the duration of BPMN processes, based on the data captured by the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The  scenario\n",
    "This notebook uses data that is stored from the BPMN process called 'Hiring Sample'. This process is a sample that is delivered with the Business Automation Workflow product. It represents the successive tasks to hire a new employee, from the submission of a new open position to the selection of the candidate, over the approval of the general manager. The purpose of this scenario is to reuse the data that is stored by this BPMN process, apply machine learning algorithms to predict the duration of a process, and possibly notify the submitter if the process is going to last long.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is not to reproduce a real scenario but rather to show how such a scenario can be worked out by using Business Automation Insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes that that IBM Business Automation Workflow is used to run the business process and that this process management instance is connected to IBM Business Automation Insights so that all the operational data of the process is stored in an HDFS data lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning goals of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understands 'time series' and 'completed summary' data from IBM Business Automation Insights\n",
    "- Explore the format of the data and learn how to read it\n",
    "- Create an ApacheÂ® Spark machine-learning pipeline to estimate process duration from existing data and business data\n",
    "- Train and evaluate the model.\n",
    "- Use the model to evaluate the duration of unfinished processes by leveraging the activity summary data of the process application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that IBM Business Automation Workflow and IBM Business Automation Insights are installed.\n"
