    "# IBM Business Automation Workflow recommendation service with IBM Business Automation Insights and Watson Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence can be combined with business processes management in many ways. For example, AI can help transforming unstructured data into data that a process can work with, through techniques such as visual or text recognition. Assistants and bots provide a better user experience and several IBM Watson services can help achieve those goals but a business process can capture lots of business data. This notebook demonstrates how to take better benefit of this data and inject machine-learning techniques to optimize processes. If for every decision that needs to be taken as part of a business process you can get a recommendation based on the decisions that have been taken in the past in similar situations, your processes are greatly enhanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The recommendation service scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario here is the following: imagine an insurance company which has set up a Workflow process to approve or reject insurance claims. Some of those insurance claims are simple because, typically, the amount is small and the customer's history and claim circumstances are straightforward. Such claims can be approved automatically or, at least, follow a fast approval path. Some claims are more complex and therefore their approval path includes more steps. Let us further assume that the approval decision or the decision on which path to follow is a human task and this task is captured as a task of a Workflow process. Then it becomes interesting to consider whether a machine-learning algorithm can help figure out which decision to take, based on past decisions.\n",
    "This scenario can be adapted to any kind of human decision process. In the insurance claim example, the decision consists in approving or rejecting a claim, which amounts to a kind of yes-or-no decision. Such decisions can translate into a binary classification machine-learning problem. However, if the decision consists in dispatching a process into many other subprocesses, the scenario becomes a multiclass classification problem, which Business Automation Insights can also handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recommendation service uses IBM Business Automation Workflow to build the claim approval process, IBM Business Automation Insights to store the business process data, and IBM Watson for artificial intelligence, in particular Watson Studio for building the machine-learning model and Watson Machine Learning for deploying that model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a schema outlines how all the different elements and cloud services are used together to build the expected service.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-DBA/bai-ai-samples/master/images/overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything starts with the business process itself, which runs in <b>IBM Business Automation Workflow</b>. As the process is running, the business data of the process, which in our scenario contains information about the insured person and the claim, is captured by the <b>Business Automation Insight (BAI)</b> service, which stores all the process operational data and in particular our claim data in HDFS. The role of this BAI service is really to capture and store this data so that the processes can be monitored and, as the name indicates, provides you with insights on the process. BAI can render various dashboards, for example to monitor the process efficiency. In this insurance claim scenario, you are more interested in the data that is associated with activities and processes rather than in the operational data. <br>\n",
    "Once the data is captured in <b>HDFS</b>, it can be used to train a machine-learning model. After the model is trained with existing claim data and approval decisions, it should be able to provide recommendations on whether to approve or reject new claims.<br>\n",
    "The trained model needs to be deployed, which is the role of the <b>IBM Watson Machine Learning</b> service. This service stores the machine-learning model and provides a scoring endpoint.\n",
    "Finally, the scoring endpoint can be invoked by the Workflow business-management process and the result transformed into a recommendation within the process user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
