# Preparation for the labs

## Environment startup

We are working on sharing of the currently available workshop environment template. It is going to be available for self-paced labs on <http://bluedemos.com>. ETA November 2020. Link to the environment template will be available here.

Before starting with the labs, start your environment using [Lab Environment Startup Instructions](/labs/environment/environment-startup.pdf). **Please do not update Windows if asked.**

## Optional - Downloading of the lab materials to your lab environment to have latest available version of the artifacts
Before starting with the labs, download lab instructions and artifacts to the lab environment:
- Open Chrome web browser on the Windows desktop of your lab environment
- Click on the "BAI Workshop Materials" link in Chrome's bookmark bar or insert address <http://ibm.biz/bai-workshop-materials>
- Click on the green download button with "Code" label and clock on "Download ZIP" and save it to directory **C:\Users\Administrator** - using this location is important for Jupyter Notebooks in the AI labs.
- Once the zip file download finishes click "Show in folder" in the context menu of the downloaded item.
- Right click on the "ibm-bai-workshop-main.zip" and select "7-Zip" > "Extract Here". You can completely rewrite the whole directory C:\Users\Administrator\ibm-bai-workshop-main if it already exists.
- Now you have all the artifacts including the lab instructions downloaded locally and unzipped in Adnimintsrator's home directory.
- Directory **C:\Users\Administrator\ibm-bai-workshop-main** containing the unzipped workshop materials will be referenced as **WORKSHOP_DIRECTORY** in all the workshop materials.
